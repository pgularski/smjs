JavaScript State Machine

--

This is a JavaScript port of [pysm (Python State Machine)](https://github.com/pgularski/pysm).

Work in progress. It's fully ported and usable but tests are needed (working on it now), and naming should be changed to follow JavaScript convention (i.e. addState instead of add_state).
